            <p> My dream is to become a web developer. I`ve crossed a long way and invested a lot of time and effort to gain knowledge and become what I am today. This web site is a presentation of my skills and hopefully  a key to start a career as a front end or back-end developer.  I am open to suggestions and eager to learn. By the time I achieve my goal, I am sure I will extend my skills and I will update this page accordingly. So take a tour and check out small apps that I build and enjoy the trip.</p>
    </Bounce>
